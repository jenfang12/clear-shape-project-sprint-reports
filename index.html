	<u>Sprint Completed Stories</u>
<p> 1.	Create Homepage</p>
<p> 2.	Create About Me page </p>
<p> 3.	Create a new event </p>

After figuring out how to deploy to Heroku, we got to working on coding. The first thing we built was the Homepage. We initially thought that we have to make the Homepage from scratch but we found out that the Homepage was actually completed for the most part from the starter code. This led us to decrease our estimate for the Create Homepage user story from 8 story points to 4 story points. Because of the realization that the starter code had a lot more than we anticipated, we actually went back to our product backlog on day 2 and pulled in an additional user story of creating the event creation page and added it to this sprint. That is the reason why you see a spike in story points on day 2. 

While the Homepage and About Me page was relatively straightforward, our developers had difficulties figuring out how to make the create a new event feature. Because of this, you will see that we did not make much progress during the middle portion of this sprint. However, we didn't give up. After asking the professor for guidance and lots of googling, Jeff was able to find a useful article online describing how to create a new event and be able to fill in basic information like location and time for the event. 

<p> <u>Product Backlog</u></p> 
<p> 1.	Storing new event details </p>
<p> 2.	Deadline for RSVP	 </p>
<p> 3.	API infrastructure for event location and directions </p>
<p> 4.	Number of registered attendess for each event </p>
While we have yet to have a detailed discussion about what exactly to build for the next sprint, we will likely focus on the first 3 stories given in the above list because those are cruical basic functions for our website. After that we will then move onto more sophisticated, nice to have, features for the third sprint. We will also use this upcoming sprint to learn more about creating API infrastructure and creating RSVP rules such as not allowing people to register after the deadline.
